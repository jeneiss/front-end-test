## Notes

### Bear in mind
Used create-react-app for quick spin up
Font wasn't provided so doesn't match wireframe
Browser spec wasn't provided so stuck to latest modern browsers
Icons not provided so used approximate Icomoon equivalents
Used Lighthouse to test performance/accessibilty: looks a-okay
Tested Chrome, Firefox and Edge, but only in Chrome emulator for mobile/tablet

### Improvements
Would be good to encapsulate the components further with, for example, styled components (I went for straight CSS as it's what I'm most comfortable with)
More time for a refactor is always useful
I feel like the code is fairly self-explanatory but could use more comments for clarity--would be good to know where the sticking points are
Should put a 404 page in there for safety
Better input validation and form building, possibly using a library like Formik
Variable naming could always use another run through
Code-splitting (can use react-router for this), although app is so small that performace is decent

### Hardest aspect of challenge
Finding the time! Perhaps I was being overly detailed but this took me a while.
